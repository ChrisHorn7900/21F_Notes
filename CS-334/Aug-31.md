# Course Themes

## Automata Theory
- What is a machine?
- What is a computer?

## Computability Theory
- What can be computed?
- What cannot be computed by any machine?
- How do I design a virus?

## Complexity Theory
- Why are some things harder to compute than others?
- Why is mutliplication easy, but factoring numbers seems hard?
- Why is it sometimes hard to solve a problem, but easy to verify it?
