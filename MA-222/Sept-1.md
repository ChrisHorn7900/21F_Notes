# Sample Spaces and Events
- an event is a subset of outcomes contained in the sample space, that is, A is a subset of Ω
- an event is simple if it contains exactly one outcome
    - example: if Ω = {$w_{1}$, $w_{2}$, ..., $w_{n}$} then {$w_{1}$} is a subset of Ω is a simple event
- an event is compound if it contains more than one outcome
- we say an event A occurs if the outcome of the experiment is contained in A
- if |Ω| = n then the numver of all possible events is 2^n (powerset)
    - example: Ω = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. All possible events? if we get a 1 what events occurred?
    - example: A = "obtain an odd number"
- **Conceptually, an outcome is a point and an event is a set (very different!)**
