# Syllabus
- No theory, no proofs in general, modeling perspective
- random experiments vs deterministic modeling
- real life examples
- probability vs statistics

# Sample Spaces and Events
- an experiment is any activity or process whose outcome is subject to uncertainty
- the sample space of an experiment, denoted by Ω is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment
- sample space is abstract
- examples
    - Binary: Ω = {D, N}
    - Ω = {NNN, NND, NDN, DNN, DND, DDN, DDD}
    - roll a standard dice: Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    - roll two dice: Ω = {(1,1), (1,2), ..., (6,6)}
- Infinite numerable: Ω = N (Natural Numbers)
- Non-numerable: R (Real Numbers)
