# Chapter 2

## Projects Cannot be run in isolation
- projects must operate in a broad organizational environment
- project managers need to use **systems thinking**:
    - taking a holistic view of carrying out projects within the context of the organization
- senior managers must make sure projects continue to support current business needs

## What Went Wrong?
- in a paper titled "A Study in Project Failure", two researchers examined the success and failure of 214 IT projects over an eight-year period in several European countries
- the researchers found that only one in eight (12.5 percent) were considered successful in terms of meeting scope, time , and cost goals
- the authors 

## Organization structures
- 3 basic organizational structures
    - **functional**: functional managers report to the CEO
    - **project**: program managers report to the CEO
    - **matrix**: middle ground between functional and project structures; personnel often report to two or more bosses; structure can be weak, balanced, or strong matrix

## Organizational Culture
- organizational culture is a st of shared assumptions, values, and behaviors that characterize the functioning of an organization
- many experts believe the underlying

## 10 Characteristics of Organizational Culture
- member identity*
- group emphasis*
- people focus
- unit integration*
- control
- risk tolerance*
- reward criteria*
- conflict tolerance*
- means-ends orientation
- open-system focus*

- *project work is most successful in an organizatonal cultlure where these ites are strong/high and other items are balanced

## Stakeholder Management
- project managers must take time to identify, understand, and manage relationships with all project stakeholders
- using the four frames of organizations can help meet stakeholder needs and experctations
- senior executives/top management are very important stakeholders
- see chapter 13, project stakeholder management, for more information

## Media Snapshot
- the media have often repoerted on mismanaged IT projects, including the disastrous launch of the website healthcare.gov in October 2013
- forbes ran an article on called "Healtcare.gov: Diagnosis: The Government Broke Every Rule of Project Management"
- President Obama formed the "Obama Trauma Team" of star performers  from several organizations to help fix the site

## The Importance of Top Management Commitment
- people in top management positions are key stakeholders inprojects
- a very important factor in helping project managers successfully lead prohects is the leve lof commitment and 

## How Top Management Can Help Project Managers
- providing adequate resources
- approving unique project needs in a timely manner
- getting cooperation from other parts of the organization
- mentoring and coaching on leadership issues

## Best Practice
- **IT governance** addresses the authority and control for key IT activities in organizations, including IT infrastructure, IT use, and project management
- a lack of IT governance can be dangerous, as evidenced by three well-publicized IT project failures in Australia (Sydney Water's customer relationship management system, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology's academic management system, and One.Tel's billing system)

## Need for Organizational Commitment
- if the organization had a negative attitude toward IT, it will be difficult for an IT project to succeed
- having a Chief Information Officer (CIO) at a high level in the organization helps IT projects
- assigning non-IT people to IT projects also encourage more commitment

## Need for Organizational Standards
- standards and guidelines help project managers be more effective
- senior management can encourage
    - the use of standard forms and software for project management
    - the development and use of guidelines for writing project plans or providing status information
    - the creation of a project management office or center of excellence

## Project Phases and the Project Life Cycle
- a **project life cycle** is a collection of project phases that defines
    - what work will be performed in each phase
    - what deliverables will be produces and when
    - who is involved in each phase, and
    - how management will control and approve work produced in each phase
- a **deliverable** is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

## Predictive Life Cycle Models
- waterfall model: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support
- spiral model: shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach
- incremental build model: provides for progressive development of operational software
- prototyping model: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements
- rapid application development (RAD) model: used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality

## Agile Software Development
- Agile software development had become popular to describe new approaches that focus on close collaboration between programming teams and business experts
- see the last section of this chapter and chapter 3 for more information on agile

## The Importance of Project Phases and Management Reviews
- a project should successfully pass through each of the project phases in order to continue on to the next
- management 

## What went right?
- "The real improvement that I saw was in our ability to - in the words of Thomas Edison - know when to stop beating a dead horse... Edison's key to success was that jhe failed fairly often; but as he said, he could recognize a dead horse before it started to smell"

## The Context of IT Projects
- IT projects can be very diverse in terms of size, complexity, products produced, application area, and resource requirements
- IT project team members often have diverse backgrounds and skill sets
- IT projects use diverse technologies that change rapidly. Even within one technology area, people must be highly specialized

## Recent Trends Affecting IT Project Management
- Globalization
- Outsourcing: **Outsourcing** is when an organization acquires good and/or sources from an outside source. **Offshoring** is sometimes used to describe outsourcing from another country
- Virtual Teams: A **virtual team** is a group of individuals who work across time and space using communication technologies
- Agile project managment

## Important Issues and Suggestions Related to Globalization
- Issues
    - Communications
    - Trust
    - Common work practices
    - Tools
- Suggestions
    - Employ greater project discipline
    - Think global but act local
    - Keep project momentum going
    - Use newer tools and technology

## Outsourcing
- Organizations remain competitive by using outsourcing to their advatage, such as finding ways to reduce costs
- Their next challenge is to make strategic IT investments with outsourcing by imporving their enterprise architecture to ensure that IT infrastructure and business processes are integrated

## Global Issues
- Outsourcing also has disadvatages. For 

## Virtual Teams Advantages
- Increasing competitiveness and repsonsiveness by having a team of workers available 24/7
- Lowering costs because many virtual workers do not require office space or support beyond their home offices
- Providing more expertise and flexibiility by having team memvers from across the globe working any time day or night
- Increasing

## Virtual Team Disadvantages
- Isolating team members
- Increasing the potential for communications problems
- Reducing the ability for team members to network and transfer information informally
- Increasing the dependence on technology to accomplish work

## Agile Project Management
- Agile means being able to move quickly and easily, but some people feel that project management, as they have seen it used, does not allow people to work quickly or easily
- Early software development projects often used a waterfall approach, as defined earlier in this chapter. As technology 

## Agile Makes Sense for Some, But Not All
- Many seasoned experts in project management warn people not to fall for the hype associated with Agile
- For example, J. Leroy Ward

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development
- In February 2001, a group of 17 people
