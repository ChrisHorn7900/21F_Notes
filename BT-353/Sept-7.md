# Chapter 2

### Projects Cannot be run in isolation
- projects must operate in a broad organizational environment
- project managers need to use **systems thinking**:
    - taking a holistic view of carrying out projects within the context of the organization
- senior managers must make sure projects continue to support current business needs

### What Went Wrong?
- in a paper titled "A Study in Project Failure", two researchers examined the success and failure of 214 IT projects over an eight-year period in several European countries
- the researchers found that only one in eight (12.5 percent) were considered successful in terms of meeting scope, time , and cost goals
- the authors 

### Organization structures
- 3 basic organizational structures
    - **functional**: functional managers report to the CEO
    - **project**: program managers report to the CEO
    - **matrix**: middle ground between functional and project structures; personnel often report to two or more bosses; structure can be weak, balanced, or strong matrix

### Organizational Culture
- organizational culture is a st of shared assumptions, values, and behaviors that characterize the functioning of an organization
- many experts believe the underlying

### 10 Characteristics of Organizational Culture
- member identity*
- group emphasis*
- people focus
- unit integration*
- control
- risk tolerance*
- reward criteria*
- conflict tolerance*
- means-ends orientation
- open-system focus*

- *project work is most successful in an organizatonal cultlure where these ites are strong/high and other items are balanced

### Stakeholder Management
- project managers must take time to identify, understand, and manage relationships with all project stakeholders
- using the four frames of organizations can help meet stakeholder needs and experctations
- senior executives/top management are very important stakeholders
- see chapter 13, project stakeholder management, for more information

### Media Snapshot
- the media have often repoerted on mismanaged IT projects, including the disastrous launch of the website healthcare.gov in October 2013
- forbes ran an article on called "Healtcare.gov: Diagnosis: The Government Broke Every Rule of Project Management"
- President Obama formed the "Obama Trauma Team" of star performers  from several organizations to help fix the site

### The Importance of Top Management Commitment
- people in top management positions are key stakeholders inprojects
- a very important factor in helping project managers successfully lead prohects is the leve lof commitment and 

### How Top Management Can Help Project Managers
- providing adequate resources
- approving unique project needs in a timely manner
- getting cooperation from other parts of the organization
- mentoring and coaching on leadership issues

### Best Practice
- **IT governance** addresses the authority and control for key IT activities in organizations, including IT infrastructure, IT use, and project management
- a lack of IT governance can be dangerous, as evidenced by three well-publicized IT project failures in Australia (Sydney Water's customer relationship management system, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology's academic management system, and One.Tel's billing system)

### Need for Organizational Commitment
- if the organization had a negative attitude toward IT, it will be difficult for an IT project to succeed
- having a Chief Information Officer (CIO) at a high level in the organization helps IT projects
- assigning non-IT people to IT projects also encourage more commitment

### Need for Organizational Standards
- standards and guidelines help project managers be more effective
- senior management can encourage
    - the use of standard forms and software for project management
    - the development and use of guidelines for writing project plans or providing status information
    - the creation of a project management office or center of excellence

### Project Phases and the Project Life Cycle
- a **project life cycle** is a collection of project phases that defines
    - what work will be performed in each phase
    - what deliverables will be produces and when
    - who is involved in each phase, and
    - how management will control and approve work produced in each phase
- a **deliverable** is a product or service produced or provided as part of a project

### Predictive Life Cycle Models
- waterfall model: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support
- spiral model: shows that software is developed using an iterative or spiral approach rather than a linear approach
- incremental build model: provides for progressive development of operational software
- prototyping model: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements
- rapid application development (RAD) model: used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing quality

### Agile Software Development
- Agile software development had become popular to describe new approaches that focus on close collaboration between programming teams and business experts
- see the last section of this chapter and chapter 3 for more information on agile

### The Importance of Project Phases and Management Reviews
- a project should successfully pass through each of the project phases in order to continue on to the next
- management 

### What went right?
- "The real improvement that I saw was in our ability to - in the words of Thomas Edison - know when to stop beating a dead horse... Edison's key to success was that jhe failed fairly often; but as he said, he could recognize a dead horse before it started to smell"

### The Context of IT Projects
- IT projects can be very diverse in terms of size, complexity, products produced, application area, and resource requirements
- IT project team members often have diverse backgrounds and skill sets
- IT projects use diverse technologies that change rapidly. Even within one technology area, people must be highly specialized
