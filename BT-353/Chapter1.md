# Chapter 1: Introduction to Project Management

## Learning Objectives, Part 1
- understand the growing need for better project management, especially for information technology (IT) projects
- explain what a project is, providing examples of IT projects, list various attributes of projects, and describe the triple constraint of project management
- describe project management and discuss key elements of the project mangemtne framework, including project stakeholders, the project mangement knowledge areas, common tools and techniques, and project success

## Learning Objectives, Part 2

- understand the role of project managers by describing what they do, what skills they need, and career opportunities for IT project managers
- describe the project management profession, including its history, the role of professional organizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI), the importance of certification and ethics, and the advancement of project managment software

## Introduction
- Many organizations today have a new or renewed interest in project managment
- Worldwide IT spending was $3.8 trillion in 2014, a 3.2 percent increase from 2013 spending
- The Project Management Institute estimates demand for 15.7 million project management jobs from 2010 to 2020, with 6.2 million of those jobs in the United States

## Project Management Statistics
- In  2013 (the most recent year of PMI's salary survey), the average salary in U.S. dollars for someone in the project management profession was $108,000 per year in the United States; $134,658 in Australia, (the highest paid country); and $24,201 in Egypt (the lowest paid country)
- The top skills employers look for in new college graduates are all related to prject management: team-work, decision-making, problem-solving, and verbal communications
- Organizations waste $109 million for every $1 billion spent on projects, according to PMI's Pulse of the Profession report

## Motivation for Studying Information Technology (IT) Project Management
- IT Projects have a terrible track record, as described in the What Went Wrong?
- A 1995 Standish Group study (CHAOS) found only 16.2% of IT projects were successful in meeting scope, time, and cost goals; over 31% of IT projects were canceled before completion
- A PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that overall half of all projects fail and only 2.5% of corporations consistently meet their targets for scope, time, and cost goals for all types of project

## Advantages of Using Formal Project Management
- Better control of financial, physical, and human resources
- Improved customer relations
- shorter development times
- lower costs
- higher quality and increased reliability
- higher profit margins
- improved productivity
- better internal coordination
- higher worker morale

## What is a Project?
- a **project** is "a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result" (PMBOK Guide, Fifth Edition, 2013)
- Operations is work done to sustain the business
- Projects end when their objectives have been reached or the project has been terminated
- Projects can be large or small and take a short or long time to complete

## Examples of IT Projects
- A team of students creates a smartphone application and sells it online
- a company develops a driverless car
- a government group develops a system to track child immunizations
- a global bank acquires other financial institutions and needs to consolidate systems and procedures

## Top Strategic Technologies for 2012 (Gartner)
- Computing everywhere
- The internet of things
- 3D printing
- Advanced, pervasive, and invisible analytics

## Media Snapshot: Unproductive Apps
- Gartner predicted that by 2014, there would be more than 70 billion mobile application downloads every year, but it was almost double
- Facebook is by far the most downloaded app, and the most popular category of all apps continues to be games
- The challenge is to develop useful apps and get workers to focus on them instead of the many distracting options available

## Project Attributes
- A project
    - has a unique purpose
    - is temporary
    - is developed using progressive elaboration
    - requires resources, often from various areas
    - should have a primary customer or sponsor
        - The **project sponsor** usually provides the direction and funding for the project
    - involves uncertainty

## Project and Program Managers
- **Project managers** work with project sponsors, project team, and other people involved in a project to meet project goals
- **Program**: group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually
- **Program managers** oversee programs; often act as bosses for project managers

## What is Project Management?
- **Project management** is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements
- project managers strive to meet the **triple constraint** (project scope, time, and cost goals) amd also facilitate the entire process to meet the needs and expectations of project stakeholders

## Project Stakeholders
- **Stakeholders** arethe people involved in or affected by project activities
- Stakeholders include
    - the project sponsor
    - the project manager
    - the project team
    - support staff
    - customers
    - users
    - suppliers
    - opponents of the project

## 10 Project Management Knowledge Areas
- **Knowledge areas** describe the key competencies that project managers must develop
- Project managers must have knowledge and skills in all 10 knowledge areas (project integration, scope, time, cost, quality, human resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management)
- This text includes an entire chapter on each knowledge area

## Project Management Tools and Techniques
- **Project Management tools and techniques** assist project managers and their teams in various aspects of project management
- some specific ones include
    - Project charte, scope statement, and WBS (scope)
    - Gantt charts, network diagrams, critical path analysis, critical chain scheduling (time)
    - Cost estimates and earned value management (cost)
    - See table 1-1 for many more

## Super Tools 
- "**Super Tools**" are those tools that have high use and high potential for improving project success, such as:
    - Software for task scheduling (such as project management software)
    - Scope statements
    - Requirement analysis
    - Lessons-learned report
- Tools already extensively used that have been found to improve project importance include:
    - Progress reports
    - Kick-off meetings
    - Gantt charts
    - Change requests

## What Went Right? Improved Project Performance
- The Standish Group's CHAOS studies how improvements in IT projects in the past decade:
    - The number of successful IT projects has more than doubled, from 16 percent in 1994 to 39 percent in 2012
    - The number of failed IT projects decreased from 31 percent in 1994 to 18 percent in 2012
    - Success rates were much higher for small projects than large ones - 76 percent vs 10 percent

## Project Success
- There are several ways to define project success:
    - The project met scope, time, and cost goals
    - The project satisfied the customer/sponsor
    - The results of the project met its main objective, such as making or saving a certain amount of money, providing a good return on investment, or simply making the sponsor happy

    - Develop a streamlined project delivery process
    - Measure project health using metrics, like customer satisfaction or return on investment

## Project Portfolio Management
- As part of **project portfolio management**, organizations group and manage projects and programs as a portfolio of investments that contribute to the entire enterprise's success
- Portfolio managers help their organizations make wise investment decisions by helping to select and analyze projects from a strategic perspective

## Best Practice
- A **best practice** is an optimal way recognized by industry to achieve a stated goal or objective
- Robert Butrick suggests that organizations need to follow basic principles of project management, including these two mentioned earlier in this chapter:
    - Make sure your projects are driven by your strategy. Be able to demonstrate how each project you undertake fits your business strategy, and screen out unwanted projects as soon as possible
    - Engage your stakeholders. Ignoring stakeholders often leads to project failure. Be sure to engage stakeholders at all stages of a project, and encourage teamwork and commitment at all times

## The Role of the Project Manager
